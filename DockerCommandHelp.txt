## Common Docker commands

## Install Docker on ubuntu
sudo apt-get install
## Start Docker
sudo systemctl start docker
## Check Docker Status
sudo systemctl status docker
## Add ubuntu user name to the docker group so you can execute Docker commands without using sudo (must log out of VM and back in to see changes)
sudo usermod -a -G docker ubuntu
## Verify that ubuntu user can run docker commands without using Sudo
docker info
## Once ubuntu user is added to docker group, can use docker commands with 'sudo' e.g. docker images, docker ps, docker ps -a, etc.

## Build from Dockerfile from root directory
docker build --tag [name you want to give the tag] .

## Start running docker container
docker run -p [local port to map to]:[port on docker container - defined by ENV in Dockerfile] --name [what you want to name the container] -d [image's repo name]

## Stop running docker container
docker stop [name of container]

## Remove container (must stop container first if running)
docker rm [name of container]

## Remove image (if any containers are running from the image, must stop and remove those containers first)
docker rmi [name of image]

## Push docker image to DockerHub (first step is to create a repo in DockerHub)
    ## First you need to tag your image with your repo name
    docker tag [image name] [tag name (should match name of your repo)]
    ## Now you can push to DockerHub
    docker push [tag name]
